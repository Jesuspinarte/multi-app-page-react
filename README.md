# Multi App page tutorial with React

This is the code made for the tutorial I made: [Creating multiple React applications on a CMS website or on a static website](https://medium.com/@jesuspinarte/creating-multiple-react-applications-on-a-cms-website-or-on-a-static-website-b42bd5fecbaa). The intention for this tutorial is to implement React Application inside CMS or static websites that are not built with as a single page application.

To follow the tutorial you have to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/download/) installed. You can follow this tutorial also with [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable).

This tutorial will help you to understand how to implement [React applications](https://es.reactjs.org/) on different architectures, which is useful when you make applications to be reused on multiple sites.
